# A Solana Backend Development Track by The Blockchain Collaborative at Baylor University
Hey Baylor Bears! This repository was designed by [Nathan Galindo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-galindo-840835195/) on behalf of [The Blockchain Collaborative at Baylor University](https://www.tbcollaborative.rocks/). It is a course that is made up of a series of projects to help you get your feet wet developing on the [Solana network](https://solana.com/). Why Solana? Because Solana is a third-generation protocol with incredibly high throughput and astonishingly low transaction fees, making it an ideal blockchain for student builders to hack around with.

# Tech Stack
Thus far, the course mainly focuses on back-end development where you will be building small applications using the Rust programming language as well as some web3 frameworks to interact with the to build on top of the Solana blockchain. Listed below are the main frameworks and tools you will be working with:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)
- [Solana Program Library](https://spl.solana.com/)
- [solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

The frameworks and tools used to build out these projects were carefully selected because they are the tools real companies are using in the blockchain industry to build out production applications. Even though they may be new to you, becoming familiar with them will greatly benefit your hireability as a software engineer (both within, and beyond the blockchain industry)!

# Getting Started
Navigate to a folder in your local environment and copy/paste the following commands into your terminal:
```
  git clone git@github.com:nathanzebedee/solana-backend-development.git
  cd solana-backend-development
```
