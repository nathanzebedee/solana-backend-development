### centralized systems
by closing a system, you can achieve security -- layers of access control to restrict access to the system and/or prevent fraudulent activity

### decentralized systems
in contrast, decentralized systems are open to the public, and therefore anyone can participate in the network. 

in a decentralized system, authority is moved to the end user, rather than a centralized authority.

centralized systems can often be easier to implement and control, however, decentralized systems are often more flexible and resilient.

### components of a blockchain
**gossip network**: 
a decentralized network of nodes that communicate with each other to share information. gossip networks are used to propagate information throughout the network.

**shared public ledger**: 
a distributed database that stores the state of the network. the ledger is shared among all nodes in the network, and is updated by consensus.

**cryptography**: 
cryptographic algorithms are used to secure the network and verify transactions. because we do not necessarily know who we are transacting with over a decentralized network, we need to be able to verify that the transaction is valid using cryptography.

### goals of decentralization
* participation
* diversity
* conflict resolution
* flexibility
* empowerment
* transparency
* censorship resistance
